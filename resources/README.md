# SQL Subquery Practice

In this exercise, I practiced writing both column subqueries and table 
subqueries in SQL. I learned how subqueries can return rows or tables 
and be used inside `IN` clauses or `FROM` clauses. The most challenging 
part was understanding the difference between where subqueries are 
allowed and making sure the data types actually match between the 
subquery and the main query. Also understand of WHERE and HAVING,
I learned that `WHERE` filters rows before grouping, and `HAVING` 
filters grouped data after aggregation.
